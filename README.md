Project & structure: Task Manager web application using Laravel and Sanctum

	This application will allow registered users to create, read, update, and edit task lists. Validation will be used to ensure that only registered users can view and edit their own lists. Users will also have the option of customizing the appearance of their list.
	The application will allow for user registration and login.
	All user input will be validated and the user will be provided with appropriate messages.
	PHP will be used for developing this application. Laravel will be used for the API/back-end of the application while Sanctum (and potentially Laravel Breeze) will be used for authentication. JS will be used to interact with the API.
